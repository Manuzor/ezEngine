  * Containers: Sorted Array (Requires Binary Search)
  * Math: Random Number Generators

Known Bugs
----------

\bug 
  * On some machines Visual Studio regularly complains about outdated precompiled headers and only a full recompile fixes it (briefly). If that occurs for you, uncheck 'EZ_USE_PCH' in the CMake GUI, then it will go away (but you also lose precompiled headers, so compilation will take longer). This is a known issue with many cmake projects and mostly seems to happen when you have both VS 2010 and VS 2012 installed and apparently some other (unknown) factors.
