/// ***** Assert Usage Guidelines *****
///
/// For your typical code, use EZ_ASSERT to check that vital preconditions are met.
/// Be aware that EZ_ASSERT is removed in release builds, INCLUDING your code in the assert condition.
/// If the code that you are checking must be executed, even in release builds, use EZ_VERIFY instead.
/// EZ_ASSERT and EZ_VERIFY will trigger a breakpoint in debug builds, but will not interrupt the application 
/// in release builds.
///
/// If you need to check something that is so vital that the application can only fail (i.e. crash), if that condition 
/// is not met, even in release builds, then use EZ_ASSERT_ALWAYS. Its condition will always be evaluated and it will
/// always trigger a breakpoint (debug) or crash the application (release).
///
/// To ensure that users are using your code correctly (e.g. they don't call certain functions before initializing the 
/// sub-system) you can use EZ_ASSERT_API. This is always active (even in release builds) to ensure that such obvious 
/// usage errors are detected. EZ_ASSERT_API should not be used in frequently executed code, as it is not stripped from 
/// release builds by default.
///
/// If you need to squeeze the last bit of performance out of your code, EZ_ASSERT_API can be disabled, by defining 
/// EZ_DISABLE_API_ASSERTS.
/// Please be aware that EZ_ASSERT_API works like the other asserts, i.e. once it is deactivated, the code in the condition 
/// is not executed anymore.
///
